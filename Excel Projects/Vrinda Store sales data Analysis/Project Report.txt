📌 Project Overview:
The dataset included key information such as order ID, customer ID, gender, age, date, status, channel, SKU, category, size, quantity, currency, amount, and shipping city. With the objective of creating an annual sales report, I embarked on a journey to explore this data and extract meaningful insights. 📊

📌Analysis Structure:
⇨ Compare the sales and orders using single chart
⇨ Which month got the highest sales and orders?
⇨ Who purchased more- men or women in 2022?
⇨ What are different order status in 2022?
⇨ List top 10 states contributing to the sales?
⇨ Relation between age and gender based on number of orders
⇨ Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
⇨ Highest selling category?
