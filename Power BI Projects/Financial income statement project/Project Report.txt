📌 Project Overview:
In this project, I created an Income statement Dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to analyze the income statement data and discover valuable insights.

📌Analysis Structure:

In order to get valuable insights the following questions and points were considered during the data analysis process:

⇨ Primary KPIs:
   a. What is Net Income ?
   b. What is Total Revenue?
   c. What is operating income ?

⇨ Show descirption of FY21 and FY22
⇨Show comparison between profit and sales revenue

By answering these questions and addressing the points mentioned above, we can provide the client with valuable insights and create a comprehensive HR data Analysis Dashboard that meets their requirements.

📌 Steps Applied:
Here's a breakdown of the project steps:

1️⃣ Understand the Data
	(i) Get the data and choose transform.
	(ii) Observe the data carefully to find the way to analyze it.

2️⃣Data Cleaning: To ensure accurate analysis
	(i) Remove Duplicates, null values 
	(ii) If a field is categorical make sure it does not have any spelling 	mistake 	by clicking the filter sign(click in any value in that column, 	click 	replace value)
	(iii) Accurately format data types by selecting all the columns, use 	transform 	tab, Click Detect data types

3️⃣Data Processing & Analysis: Transforming raw data into a structured format
	(i) Use KPI's to Build KPI's , Fill current and target value with trend axis 	Copy and paste the formated card as per the 	required 	KPI's and 	change the value in field space.
	(ii) Create index column to add tables in dashboard for right row config.
	(iii) Clustered column chart for visualizing the comparison between profit 	and revenue

Step 4️⃣: Dashboard Creation
In the final stage, I created a comprehensive dashboard that encapsulated the insights gained from the data analysis. I used an image for the canvas background.

 
🔎 Key Insights:
1️⃣ Net income has increased by 18.7% compared to FY21.
2️⃣ Total revenue has increased by 17.9% compared to FY21.
3️⃣ Operating income has increased by 19.2% compared to FY21.
